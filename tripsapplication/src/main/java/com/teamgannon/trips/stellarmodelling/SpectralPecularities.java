     * certain to decay by emitting a forbidden-line photon. Since meta-stable states are rather common,

     * gas in space. Forbidden transitions in highly charged ions resulting in the emission of visible,
     * vacuum-ultraviolet, soft x-ray and x-ray photons are routinely observed in certain laboratory devices
     * such as electron beam ion traps [8] and ion storage rings, where in both cases residual gas densities
     * are sufficiently low for forbidden line emission to occur before atoms are collisionally de-excited.
     * Using laser spectroscopy techniques, forbidden transitions are used to stabilize atomic clocks and
     * quantum clocks that have the highest accuracies currently available.
